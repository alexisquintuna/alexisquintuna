# Hola! 🤟🏽

Developer by day.
<br>
Developer by night too...

Full-stack developer, with a slight addiction to front-end development.

I create for me, for you, for ya. 

Creating a user experience that makes you go "Ooo...I like that"

## **Currently:**
  🧑🏽‍💼 Work: Barista <a href="https://www.rooseveltcoffee.org/" target="_blank">@Roosevelt Coffeehouse</a>  || Freelance
  <br>
  <br>
  🎥 Movies: been watching a lot of Studio Ghibli movies.
  <br>
  <br>
  🔊 Music: really into live jazz, saw whiplash once and was like "ooo..I like that"
  <br>
  <br>
  👀 Looking for: 
  <br>
    1. how to enhance a users experiences on mobile
    <br>
    2. tools that make it easier for me to create magic
    <br>
    3. reasons why not to get <a href="https://www.alexisquintuna.com/static/media/Pebbles.c56e3d8f05538d2efe81.png" target="_blank">Pebbles</a> a cat friend.
